# Sorting Hat

This site is a sorting house tool to sort students into the four houses in Harry Potter. It takes a new students name, and randomly assigns them a house which is also color coordinated. 

When the expel button is pressed, the student is removed from the student body and sent to 'Voldemort's Army'. The card styling also changes when a student is expelled.
